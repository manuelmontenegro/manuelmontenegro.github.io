            <h1>About</h1>

<p>I got my Computer Science degree in 2006 at <a href="https://informatica.ucm.es">Computer Science School</a> of <a href="https://www.ucm.es">Complutense University of Madrid</a>, where I also received my M.Sc. in Computer Science Research and my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2011.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I hold a degree in Mathematics specializing in Statistics and Operations Research at <a href="https://www.uned.es">UNED</a> in 2014.</p>
<p>Currently I work as an associate professor in the <a href="https://www.ucm.es/dsic-1-1">Department of Information Systems and Computation</a> at <a href="https://www.ucm.es">UCM</a>.</p>


<h3>Research</h3>
<p>In the course of my Ph.D. thesis I engaged in research in the field of Static Analysis of Programs, specifically on the development of pointer safety and memory bound analyses for Safe, a functional language without garbage collection. I have also completed research stages in the Digital Security Department of <a href="https://www.ru.nl/">Radboud University Nijmegen</a> (Netherlands) and in the Department of Information Systems of <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/">MÃ¼nster University</a> (Germany).</p>
<p>Currently I pursue research in the fields of Computer-Aided Program Verification, Invariant Synthesis and other aspects of Declarative Programming such as Type Systems.</p>


<h3>Teaching</h3>

<p>My teaching experience comprises a wide range of subjects. I have taught courses on:

<ul>
    <li>Advanced Databases (Computer Science Degree)</li>
    <li>Web Development (Software Engineering Degree)</li>
    <li>Java and Web Services (M.Sc. in Engineering Mathematics)</li>
    <li>Applied Declarative Programming (M.Sc. in Computer Science)</li>
    <li>Functional Programming (Computer Science Degree)</li>
    <li>Logic Programming (Computer Science Degree)</li>
    <li>Static Analysis of Programs and Constraint Solving (M.Sc. in Formal Methods in Computer Science)</li>
    <li>Theory of Programming Languages (M.Sc. in Formal Methods in Computer Science)</li>
    <li>Data Structures (several degrees in Computer Science at UCM)</li>
</ul>
 
 <p>Besides that, in recent years I have taken part in several innovative teaching projects at UCM, leading two of them.</p>
 <p>For several years running, I have participated in the DOCENTIA teaching assessment program at UCM, achieving three excellent and four very positive ratings.</p>
